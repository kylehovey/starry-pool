Interior of a sea cave at night framing a placid ocean with subtle ripples reflecting a night sky of twinkling stars. Large stalactites and stalagmites silhouette the scene, and the sky itself is uniform without stars to the naked eye. Only in the reflection can you see the stars. The cave ceiling is populated by mysterious flying yellow, cyan, and green bokeh.
